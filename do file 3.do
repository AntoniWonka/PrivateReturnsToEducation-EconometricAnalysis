* D) Health remains numeric (1=Excellent .. 5=Poor), no recode needed
*    but you can label it if you wish:
* label variable HEA "Health status (1=Excellent, 5=Poor)"

* E) Hours worked squared

* Explanation:
*  - 'degree' : Categorical education variable (0â€“4) 
*  - 'A_AGE' & 'age_squared' : Age (experience proxy)
*  - 'female' : Gender dummy (1=Female)
*  - 'white'  : Race dummy (1=White)
*  - 'married': Marital status dummy
*  - 'HEA'    : Health index
*  - 'HRSWK'  : Hours worked per week
*  - 'hrswk_sq': Hours worked squared
*  - robust
